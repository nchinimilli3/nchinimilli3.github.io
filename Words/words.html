                <p>EAST LANSING, MI * This is a letter to Sujay Rao. Happy birthday to the love of my life and much more. Today is the day you leave teenagehood behind and venture into being not a teenager. To say I love you is not enough to express my depth is an understatement. I don't even know if love is a strong enough word. I need you at this point. You are such a basic need in my life like water and air. 
                </p>
                <p> Your birthday is such a special day like a national holiday and I'm so excited and grateful to spend it with you (in a suit). Where do I even start about how grateful I am for you. You are my favorite person to spend time with and spending the entire day with you is still not enough, </p>

                  assit efforst to help customers affected by the crisis. "When a company scews up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media and you control the story. Wait for them to find out and the story controls you. That's what happened to OJ," said Scott.

                  Creed Bratton, Director of Quality Assurance for Dunder Mifflin Scranton, stated that he was scheduled to meet with Debbie Brown, a representative at the paper manufacturer, for a quality check the week prior but was informed that she was out with the flu, or for an emergency dentist appointment, preventing Bratton from catching the mistake. Calls to Debbie Brown were not returned. The Times later learned that Brown had been relieved of her duties at the paper manufacturer as a result of the watermakr situation.

                  Mifflin's important and most tenured clients, was invited to the branch for a formal apology by Michael Scott. "Mrs. Allen is our most important client, because every client is our most important client, even though she's a pretty unimportant client," said Scott.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident and, as a gesture of gratitude for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present

            <p>
              Allen, clearly upset and frustrated with the "watermark boner," demanded that Scott resign his position to satisfy her after being asked how the company could make the situation right. Allen then state that as she headof the company Scott should lose his position. "You should lose your job!" scolded ALlen. Scott refused resignation, stating to Allen that "it wasn't my fault, it was the guys at the paper mill."
            </p>
            <p> Dwight Schrute, Assistant to the Regional Manager and Senior Sales Associate, state that the "sex appeared to be consensual as both animals were smiling."

            <p>
              Allen threatened to contact the Better Business Bureau as she was asked to leave to which Scott retorted that he would be calling the "ungrateful beyotch hotline."
            </p>
            <p>
              In a panic, Scott released an apology video that was posted online. In it, Scott states that "it wasn't me (referencing who put the watermark on the paper). They are trying to make me an escape goat."

              The Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin Paper recently merged with the Stamford, CT branch as the company looked to cut costs. Dunder Mifflin also has branches in Buffalo Albany, Utica, Yonkers, Akron, Camden, binghamton and Nashua. The closure of the Stamford branch folows a closure in Pittsfield, MA due to employees possible unionization.
