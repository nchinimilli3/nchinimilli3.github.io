                <p>EAST LANSING, MI * This is a letter to Sujay Rao. Happy birthday to the love of my life and much more. Today is the day you leave teenagehood behind and venture into being not a teenager. To say I love you is not enough to express my depth is an understatement. I don't even know if love is a strong enough word. I need you at this point. You are such a basic need in my life like water and air. 
                </p>
                <p> Your birthday is such a special day like a national holiday and I'm so excited and grateful to spend it with you (in a suit). Where do I even start about how grateful I am for you. You are my favorite person to spend time with and spending the entire day with you is still not enough. </p>
                <p>
                  I am so in love with you and I hope our love never grows old and when we're 65 years old with gray hair and wrinkles but still GILFS, I am so happy that you are still the face I see when I wake up.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  I am so happy that you are the last face I see when I might have had a few too many shots or I am so tired that 5 minutes is too much. I am so happy that your laugh will always be the best soundtrack in my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I love that every day of the rest of our lives are spent loving each other; not a single thing could convince me not to love you and with you by my side, what more do I need?
                </p>
                <p>
                  I knew you were the one the very first time we even spoke at the coffee chat because first of all, I remember there were absolutely no seats at Broad when I came. Even the steps were filled to the brim and the ONLY seat that was free was the one at Shreya's table and across from you—in hindsight, isn't that destined to be? I fell into conversation with you so easily it felt like I've known you for years which I have never felt in my life, even with my bestest bestest friends. I remember distinctly texting Anjani about it afterwards and sending your PGN headshot from the Instagram or something and telling her I was so excited to see you at St. Patty's. I had a crush on you like never in my life I swear. 
                </p>

                   I knew the first day after Dublin when we stayed up until 7AM just talking and how I didn't even feel tired after the entire night. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I knew when you came over a few days later and literally would not take no for an answer when I said I never said the N word. Legit I was like this man is so fucking goofy wtf—only for that to be one of the things I love about you the most. I knew a few days later when you saw my arm and wanted to know more about it instead of getting freaked out. Honestly, I'd say depression is unfortunately a pretty big part of my life and the fact that you were immediately so accepting and I even felt more comfortable than ever opening up to you was very affirming, though the bar was low.

              Every instance after that just confirmed in my mind how easy and natural is to be with you. How I just know that you're the one. There's no explanation or reasoning as to why you're the one and how I just know, but I do. Everything about you is like you're meant to enrich my life in the best possible ways. Also, speaking of destiny or luck or both, but good shit that we live in proximity to each other back home and in East Lansing. Imagine you lived in like Troy and it's like a 40 minute drive each way to see you. Or you didn't live a 3 minute walk here. 
            </p>
            <p> If it weren't for you and your words of affirmations and communicative nature, I would have stayed the same. Because of you, I actually feel the motivation to improve and grow. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The future with you is the only future that doesn't make me die from anxiety. Our future is the bright light in my vision and I know I can just always rely on the thought of that and you to give me reassurance, support, and motivation to do anything. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I can't wait to fulfill all of our goals together. I can't wait to always sleep in your arms and our perfect position. I can't wait to kiss you and hug you and kiss you again and hug you again and kiss you again and again and again because I love the way your lips feel on mine.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm so grateful to go on adventures with you because nothing comes close to topping them. I'm so so so in love with being domestic with you and can't wait to do that for the rest of my life. I am so grateful that I met you because you make everything in my past worth it, the present so amazing, and the future so exciting. Every crevice in my brain is filled with thoughts of you and I'd have it no other way. You are my everything and more and I'm so so so happy to celebrate you today and everyday. HAPPY 20 Sujay I love you so much forever, no matter what.
